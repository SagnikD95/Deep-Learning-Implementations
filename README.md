# Deep Learning Models

1. MNIST_Analysis: This is a Deep learning model for MNIST digit classification. We verify class balance, develop MNIST model, visualize feature maps and training/testing plots.

2. MNIST_GenerativeAdversarialNetwork: This is a basic GAN implementation for generating MNIST digits. 

3. Crack Detection: This is a deep learning implementation of detection of crack in images. This finds application in industrial manufacturing lines for defect identification to reduce resources.

4. EMNIST Federated Learning: This is a replication of the Tensorflow's implementation of Federated Learning on MNIST dataset for understanding the basic concepts of Federated Learning.
